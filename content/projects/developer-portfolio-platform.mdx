## Overview

This platform powers the personal engineering site, focusing on fast static delivery, low coupling, and simple authoring.

## Architecture

- Next.js App Router with output export for fully static artifact.
- MDX content loaded at build for deterministic deploys.
- Minimal custom scripts assemble static assets for GitHub Pages.

## Outcomes

Fast iteration enabling rapid additions (galleries, projects) with minimal churn. Baseline for future performance instrumentation & automated budgets.

## Next Steps

- Add RSS feed generation.
- Fetch live GitHub repo metadata for OSS section.
- Pre-build image optimization pipeline.
